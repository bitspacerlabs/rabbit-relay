# What is Rabbit Relay?

Rabbit Relay is a **reliable, type-safe RabbitMQ event framework for Node.js**.

It is built on top of `amqplib` and focuses on **correctness, clarity, and learning**, without hiding RabbitMQ concepts behind opaque abstractions.

Rabbit Relay is designed for:
- Event-driven systems
- Microservices
- Message-heavy workloads
- Teams that care about reliability and observability

## Philosophy

> **Rabbit Relay aims to be easy to understand and hard to misuse.
It helps teams build reliable systems while still learning how RabbitMQ actually works.**
