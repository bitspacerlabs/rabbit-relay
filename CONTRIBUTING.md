# Contributing to Rabbit Relay 🐇⚡

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute!  
**Rabbit Relay** is an open-source project built with the goal of making RabbitMQ usage in Node.js **reliable, type-safe, and developer-friendly**.  
Contributions of all kinds are welcome 💙

---

## Project Philosophy

Rabbit Relay is built around a few core principles:

- **Type safety first** (TypeScript-driven APIs)
- **Reliability over magic**
- **Explicit, predictable behavior**
- **Minimal runtime dependencies**
- **Production-ready by default**

Every contribution should aim to support these goals.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in many ways, including:

- Reporting bugs  
- Proposing or implementing new features  
- Adding tests or improving coverage  
- Improving documentation or examples  
- Refactoring or improving internal code quality  
- Suggesting design or API improvements  

If you’re unsure where to start, check existing issues or open a discussion.

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs

Before opening a new issue:

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates  
2. Make sure you're using the latest version  
3. Provide as much detail as possible  

Please include:

- Rabbit Relay version  
- Node.js version  
- RabbitMQ version  
- Minimal reproducible example (if possible)  
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior  
- Error logs or stack traces  

---

## ✨ Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome!

Please describe:

- The problem you're trying to solve  
- Why existing solutions are insufficient  
- How the feature fits Rabbit Relay’s philosophy  
- Proposed API shape (TypeScript examples encouraged)  

Large changes should be discussed before implementation.

## 🛠 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or pnpm
- A running RabbitMQ instance (Docker is fine)

### Install dependencies

```

## Code Style & Conventions

- TypeScript only  
- Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary  
- Prefer explicit types for public APIs  
- Avoid breaking changes unless discussed  
- Keep functions small and focused
